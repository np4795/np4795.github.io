 I graduated from UCF with a Health Sciences degree, I wanted to pursue a career within the healthcare field. I previously worked as a medical scribe to gain experience in the healthcare field. After 3 years of working as a scribe, I began to realize healthcare is not what I wanted to truly do. A few months ago, I spoke to one of my close friends who is a software engineer at Microsft. He advised me to look into coding and bootcamps because he knew my personality quite well. Thus, I began to learn and gain more information on free coding classes and I began to take CS50 from Edx. While learning and going through the class, I began to find enjoyment in problem solving and seeing the daily application of coding. Coding is everywhere in my everyday life, it's amazing how vast and large the scope of coding is. That experience lead me into further researching about coding bootcamps to establish a career in the software development field. So far going through the coding bootcamp, I'm enjoying trying to figure each lab and learning about coding. Even though it is still very early in my coding path, I look forward to learning the different coding languages and becoming a software developer.
